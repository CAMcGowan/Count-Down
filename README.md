# Count-Down
This repo is for a python version of the game countdown.

Currently the game has features classes for both a number round and word round. This is found in main.py.
The word round features a letter selector with the option of vowels or consonants and all letters have assigned weightings as they do in the show. 
The word round currently has no solution generator.
The number round allows the user to choose either big or small numbers, it also has a target generator which can be use to re-gen the target multiple times,
further it also has a solver which returns the shortest solution to the problem.

letter wightings found at - http://www.thecountdownpage.com/letters.htm
letters.txt shows the weightings used for each letter.

runs using numpy package.
